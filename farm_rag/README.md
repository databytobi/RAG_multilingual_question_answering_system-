OVERVIEW 

This notebook demonstrates the development of a multilingual question-answering system capable of responding in multiple languages, specifically showcasing functionality in Swahili and English. The system leverages a combination of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and an agent equipped with web search capabilities to provide comprehensive and up-to-date answers. The core idea is to first attempt to answer questions using a curated set of internal documents (RAG) and, if the internal knowledge is insufficient, to use a web search tool to find the relevant information. Translation capabilities are integrated to handle questions and provide answers in the user's preferred language.

MOTIVATION
The motivation behind this project is to build a question-answering system that is not limited by language barriers or static knowledge. By incorporating multilingual support, the system can serve a wider audience. The combination of RAG and an agent provides a robust approach: RAG offers efficient access to domain-specific information from known sources, while the agent's web search capability allows the system to address questions requiring current or external knowledge. This hybrid approach aims to deliver accurate and relevant answers from both internal and external information sources.

KEY COMPONENTS
The system is built upon several key components:

1. Language Models (LLMs): The project utilizes the Google Generative AI models (specifically Gemini) for generating answers and powering the agent's reasoning.

2. Translation Models: MarianMT models from Hugging Face are used for translating user questions into English (for processing) and translating the final English answer back to the user's language.

3. Document Loading and Splitting: LangChain's TextLoader (simulated with dummy data) and RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter are used to prepare text data for the RAG system.

4. Embeddings: HuggingFaceEmbeddings are employed to create vector representations of the text chunks, enabling semantic search.

5. Vector Store: FAISS is used as the vector store to efficiently store and search the document embeddings.

6. RetrievalQA Chain: This LangChain component handles the RAG process, retrieving relevant document chunks based on the user's query and feeding them to the LLM to generate an answer.

7. Agent: A LangChain agent, initialized with the zero-shot-react-description type, is used to decide whether to use the RAG output or perform a web search based on the context.

8. Web Search Tool: The DuckDuckGoSearchRun tool is integrated into the agent to enable web search when needed.

METHODS

The system follows the following workflow:

Initialization: Necessary libraries are installed, API keys are loaded, language models for translation and generation are configured, and the embedding model and vector store are set up with the internal documents.

Question Input: The user provides a question in their preferred language (e.g., Swahili or English).

Translation to English: If the question is not in English, it is translated to English using the Swahili-to-English translation model.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): The English query is used to perform a similarity search on the FAISS vector store. The most relevant document chunks are retrieved.

Answer Generation (RAG First): The retrieved document chunks and the English query are passed to the RetrievalQA chain. The LLM generates an answer based on the provided context.

Agent Decision (Fallback to Web Search): The system checks if the RAG process returned any source documents.

If no source documents are found: The agent is invoked with the English query. The agent's prompt guides it to use the "Web Search" tool to find information. The agent then generates an answer based on the web search results.

If source documents are found: The answer generated by the RAG chain is used as the final answer.

Translation to User Language: If the original question was not in English, the final English answer is translated back to the user's language using the English-to-Swahili (or other target language) translation model.

Output: The final answer is presented to the user in their preferred language.

BENEFITS OF THE APPROACH
This approach offers several benefits:

Multilingual Support: The integrated translation allows the system to interact with users in languages other than English, expanding its accessibility.

Hybrid Knowledge Source: Combining RAG with a web search agent provides access to both internal, curated knowledge and up-to-date external information. This makes the system more comprehensive and resilient to questions outside its initial knowledge base.

Efficiency: RAG is typically faster and more cost-effective for answering questions within the scope of the internal documents. The agent's web search is used only when necessary, optimizing resource usage.

Improved Accuracy: By prioritizing RAG when relevant documents exist, the system can provide answers grounded in specific, trusted sources. The fallback to web search ensures that questions requiring current information can still be addressed.

Flexibility: The modular nature of LangChain allows for easy integration of different LLMs, embedding models, vector stores, and tools.

CONCLUSION
This project successfully demonstrates the creation of a multilingual question-answering system that effectively utilizes RAG and an intelligent agent with web search capabilities. The system can understand and respond to questions in different languages by translating them to English for processing and translating the final answer back to the user's language. The hybrid approach of prioritizing RAG and falling back to web search provides a robust and flexible solution for accessing and delivering information. This architecture can be further extended and refined by incorporating more sophisticated translation models, expanding the internal document base, and adding more specialized tools to the agent.
